## Overview

GAN Lab is a novel interactive visualization tool for anyone to learn and experiment with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), a popular class of complex deep learning models. With GAN Lab, you can interactively train GAN models for 2D data distributions and visualize their inner-workings, similar to [TensorFlow Playground](http://playground.tensorflow.org/).

GAN Lab uses [TensorFlow.js](https://js.tensorflow.org/), an in-browser GPU-accelerated deep learning library. Everything, from model training to visualization, is implemented with JavaScript. Users only need a web browser like Chrome to run GAN Lab. Our implementation approach significantly broadens people's access to interactive tools for deep learning.

## Working Demo

Click the following link:

[https://poloclub.github.io/ganlab/](https://poloclub.github.io/ganlab/)

It runs on most modern web browsers. We suggest you use Google Chrome.


## Development

This section describes how you can develop GAN Lab.

### Install Dependencies

Run the following commands: 

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/poloclub/ganlab.git
$ cd ganlab
$ yarn prep
```

It's unlikely, but you may need to install some basic JavaScript-related dependencies (e.g., yarn).


### Running Your Demo

Run the following command:

```bash
$ ./scripts/watch-demo

>> Waiting for initial compile...
>> 3462522 bytes written to demo/bundle.js (2.17 seconds) at 00:00:00
>> Starting up http-server, serving ./
>> Available on:
>>   http://127.0.0.1:8080
>> Hit CTRL-C to stop the server
```

Then visit `http://localhost:8080/demo/`. 

The `watch-demo` script monitors for changes of typescript code (e.g., `demo/ganlab.ts`)
and compiles the code for you.
